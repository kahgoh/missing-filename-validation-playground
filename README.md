# Missing Filename Validation Playground
This project was created to use a sandbox to experiment with receiving a file upload in Noode and ExpressJS. It is a node-expressjs app with a single page presenting a list of uploaded files (without validating the filename). 

## Running
After cloning or downloading and unzipping:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then point your web browser to http://localhost:3000.
