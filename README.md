# Missing Filename Validation Playground
This project was created for [The Importance of Validating Filenames](https://kahdev.hashnode.dev/the-importance-of-validating-filenames). It is a node-expressjs app with a single page presenting a list of uploaded files (without validating the filename). 

## Running
After cloning or downloading and unzipping:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then point your web browser to http://localhost:3000.
